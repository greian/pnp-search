# Search Extensibility - Field Value

## Summary

This code example is a Search Extension that can be used in the PnP Search Web Parts by including a <field-value> component in the handlebar code.
The field-value extension shows the value of a field based on a site url, an item id and a list name. The code handles different types of values (text, numbers, dates, managed metadata, etc.). In the PnP Search Results Web Part, handelbars can be used to create the layout of the search result, and Managed Properties from the search index are used to display the values. But, in some cases, you might want to pick up the actual value of a field using the id of the item. Here is an example of how this can be used in a PnP Handlebar Template:
